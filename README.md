## Course Overview

This repository is designed to help MCA first-year students master the essentials of Python programming. The course is structured to provide both conceptual clarity and practical exposure, with a blend of theoretical notes, code snippets, assignments, and mini projects.

---

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Introduction to Python, Input/Output and Operators _(7 Periods)_

- Features and history of Python
- Installation & IDEs (Jupyter, VS Code)
- Interpreter vs Compiler
- Using `input()` and `print()`
- Formatted strings (`f-strings`, `format()`)
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Dynamic typing & type conversions (explicit, implicit)
- Operator types: arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, membership, identity
- Expression evaluation, precedence & associativity
- Comments: single-line & multi-line

---

### Module 2: Decision Making and Looping _(7 Periods)_

- `if`, `if-else`, `elif`, nested conditions
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- Functions: `enumerate()`, `zip()`
- `else` with loops
- List and dictionary comprehensions
- Combining loops with conditionals
- Basic exception handling: `try-except`

---

### Module 3: Data Structures, Strings, Functions & Recursion _(10 Periods)_

- Strings: creation, indexing, slicing, immutability
- String methods: `upper()`, `lower()`, `find()`, `replace()`, `split()`, `join()`
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Function definition, parameters, return values, default/keyword arguments
- Recursion (examples: factorial, Fibonacci)
- Function integration with strings & collections
- Lambda functions, `map()`, `filter()`

---

### Module 4: Object-Oriented Programming in Python _(7 Periods)_

- Classes and objects
- Instance variables and methods
- Constructors (`__init__`) & destructors
- Encapsulation (public, protected, private)
- Inheritance (types, method overriding)
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction (using `abc` module)

---

### Module 5: Data Visualization & Web Development _(14 Periods)_

- Importance & purpose of data visualization
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib: line graphs, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots
- Flask: overview, setup, app structure, routing
- Template rendering with Jinja2
- Form handling: GET/POST methods
- Basic CRUD operations
- HTML/CSS integration
- Mini project implementation

---

## Course Outcomes

After completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate knowledge of Python constructs, sequences, sets, and dictionaries to solve computational problems.
- Apply regular expressions for pattern searching in strings.
- Develop and use Python modules to solve problems.
- Apply file operations in Python for file processing.
- Design applications using OOP features: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.
- Work independently to solve problems and communicate effectively.

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Each module will have its dedicated folder with lecture notes, code samples, and exercises.
- Access the notes in markdown format for easy reading and sharing.
- Refer to the code samples and mini projects for hands-on practice.
