1. History of Python
--------------------

- **Created by:** Guido van Rossum
- **First released:** 1991
- **Motivation:** To create an easy-to-read, powerful, and versatile
  programming language.
- **Development Timeline:**

  - 1980s: Initial development began as a successor to the ABC language.
  - 1991: Python 0.9.0 released (included classes, functions, exception
    handling).
  - 2000: Python 2.0 released (added list comprehensions, garbage
    collection).
  - 2008: Python 3.0 released (major improvements, not backward
    compatible).

- **Current Status:** Widely used in web development, data science,
  automation, AI, and more.

2. Features of Python
---------------------

- **Simple and Easy to Learn:** Clear syntax, similar to English.
- **Interpreted Language:** No need for compilation; code runs line by
  line.
- **Dynamically Typed:** No need to declare variable types explicitly.
- **Extensive Standard Library:** Rich set of modules and functions for
  various tasks.
- **Portability:** Runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS,
  etc.).
- **Open Source:** Freely available and community-driven development.
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports classes and objects.
- **High-Level Language:** Abstracts low-level details.
- **Embeddable and Extensible:** Can integrate with other languages like
  C/C++.
- **Large Community Support:** Extensive documentation and active
  forums.
