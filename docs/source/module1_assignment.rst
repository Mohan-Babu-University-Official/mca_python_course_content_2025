Python Assignment Questions: Variables, Operators, Datatypes**10. Greeting Message**

    Take a name as input and print "Hello, <name>".

    *Hint:* Use f-string formatting like `f"Hello, {name}"` or string concatenation.Input & Output
===========================================================================

.. note::
   Do not use any conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) or loops in your solutions.

**1. Swapping Variables**

   Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables entered by the user.

   *Hint:* Use a temporary variable or Python's tuple unpacking to swap values.

**2. Simple Calculator (No Conditions)**

   Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input from the user and prints the result.

   *Hint:* Use `eval()` or separate conditions for operators, but since no conditions allowed, use `eval()` with the expression.

**3. Type Conversion**

   Ask the user to input a number as a string. Convert it to an integer and a float, then print both values and their types.

   *Hint:* Use `int()`, `float()`, and `type()` to show the types.

**4. Quadratic Equation Roots (No Conditions)**

   Write a program that takes three numbers as input: `a`, `b`, and `c` for the equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. Calculate the roots using the formula.

   *Hint:* Use `**` for power and `complex()` if you get a negative square root. Do not use any modules or conditions.

**5. Custom Data Type Formatter**

   Take input of a person's name, age, and height (in cm). Print a formatted string: `"Name: <name>, Age: <age> years, Height: <height> cm"`. Also, make sure age is an integer and height is a float.

   *Hint:* Use `input()`, `int()`, `float()`, and f-strings for formatting.

**6. Complex Expression Evaluator**

   Write a program that takes three numbers from the user and calculates the result of the expression: `((num1 + num2) * num3) / (num1 - num2)`. Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places.

   *Hint:* Use parentheses for the calculation and `round()` for formatting. If you get an error (like dividing by zero), Python will show it.

**7. Sum of Two Numbers**

   Write a program to take two numbers as input and print their sum.

   *Hint:* Use the `+` operator to add the numbers.

**8. Uppercase String**

   Take a string as input and print it in uppercase.

   *Hint:* Use the `.upper()` method on the string.

**9. Square of a Number**

   Input a number and print its square.

   *Hint:* Use the `**` operator with exponent 2 or multiply the number by itself.

10. **Greeting Message**
    Take a name as input and print "Hello, <name>".

**11. String Concatenation**

    Input two strings and print them concatenated together.

    *Hint:* Use the `+` operator to join the strings.

**12. Float to Integer Conversion**

    Take a float as input and print its integer equivalent using `int()`.

    *Hint:* Use `int()` to convert the float to an integer, which truncates the decimal part.

**13. Age Display**

    Input an age as a number and print "You are <age> years old".

    *Hint:* Convert the input to int if needed and use f-string for formatting.

**14. Product of Two Numbers**

    Take two numbers as input and print their product.

    *Hint:* Use the `*` operator to multiply the numbers.

**15. String Length**

    Input a sentence and print its length using `len()`.

    *Hint:* Apply `len()` directly to the input string.

**16. Average of Three Numbers**

    Take three numbers as input and print their average.

    *Hint:* Sum the numbers and divide by 3, use parentheses for clarity.

**17. Absolute Value**

    Input a number and print its absolute value using `abs()`.

    *Hint:* Use the built-in `abs()` function.

**18. Difference of Two Numbers**

    Take two numbers as input and print their difference.

    *Hint:* Subtract the second number from the first using the `-` operator.

**19. String Reversal**

    Input a string and print it reversed using slicing.

    *Hint:* Use slicing with `[::-1]` to reverse the string.

**20. Height Conversion**

    Input height in centimeters and print it converted to meters.

    *Hint:* Divide the height by 100 to convert cm to meters.

**21. Quotient of Two Numbers**

    Take two numbers as input and print their quotient.

    *Hint:* Use the `/` operator for division.

**22. Quoted Name**

    Input a name and print it surrounded by double quotes.

    *Hint:* Use f-string like `f'"{name}"'` or concatenation with quotes.

**23. Formatted Number**

    Take a number as input and print it rounded to 2 decimal places.

    *Hint:* Use `round(number, 2)` to round to 2 decimal places.

**24. String Separation**

    Input two strings and print them separated by a space.

    *Hint:* Use f-string like `f"{str1} {str2}"` or concatenation with a space.

**25. Type of Input**

    Take any input and print its type using `type()`.

    *Hint:* Apply `type()` to the input variable.

**26. Sum and Product**

    Input three numbers and print their sum and their product.

    *Hint:* Calculate sum with `+` and product with `*`, print both.
