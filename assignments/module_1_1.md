## Python Assignment Questions: Variables, Operators, Datatypes, Input & Output

> **Note:** Do not use any conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) or loops in your solutions.  

1. **Swapping Variables**  
    Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables entered by the user.  

2. **Simple Calculator (No Conditions)**  
    Create a program that takes two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input from the user and prints the result.  

3. **Type Conversion**  
    Ask the user to input a number as a string. Convert it to an integer and a float, then print both values and their types.  
    *Hint: Use `int()`, `float()`, and `type()` to show the types.*

4. **Quadratic Equation Roots (No Conditions)**  
    Write a program that takes three numbers as input: `a`, `b`, and `c` for the equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. Calculate the roots using the formula.  
    *Hint: Use `**` for power and `complex()` if you get a negative square root. Do not use any modules or conditions.*

5. **Custom Data Type Formatter**  
    Take input of a person's name, age, and height (in cm). Print a formatted string:  
    `"Name: <name>, Age: <age> years, Height: <height> cm"`  
    Also, make sure age is an integer and height is a float.  
    *Hint: Use `input()`, `int()`, `float()`, and f-strings for formatting.*

6. **Complex Expression Evaluator**  
    Write a program that takes three numbers from the user and calculates the result of the expression:  
    `((num1 + num2) * num3) / (num1 - num2)`  
    Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places.  
    *Hint: Use parentheses for the calculation and `round()` for formatting. If you get an error (like dividing by zero), Python will show it.*
